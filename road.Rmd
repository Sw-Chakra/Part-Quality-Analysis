#### Data Processing: 

The manipulation and analysis of the data and its structure required some pre-processing which has been performed

\  

#### Data Analysis: 

Performed statistical tests on the measurement distributions to find some interesting facts

\  

#### Dimensionality Reduction :  

3D measurement of features come as wide format data with correlations, which could be a hinderance while building predictive models 

This can be overcomed by performing a dimensional reduction using PCA or similar techniques (selection of top N eigen values and eigen vectors of the feature covariance matrix) 

In case of linear regressions, we can also consider lasso regression to build sparse models with key features (to be explored)

\  

#### Interactive Website: 

Built an interactive website (integration of R & Shiny) to assess quality of several critical dimensions machined at Teslaâ€™s Assembly Line

Demonstrated the frequency and extent of failures across the parts and batches through a visibly accessible format 

\  

#### Decision support tool: 

Developed predictive model for decisions and strategy
