### Objectives

  *  To Highlight worst performing features compared to individual tolerances.
  
  *  To find the features which have the largest differences between fixtures.
  
  *  To find the features which have the largest differences between machines.
  
  *  To provide a summary of part quality.

### Assumptions:

### Constraints

* The look up dictionary for the term 'Nominal' was not available. Hence it was assumed that all measurement observations are relative to the Nominal value and it would not have significant contribution while performing different comparisons
  
* The measurement values are not normally distributed. Some of the tranformations that were explored are log transformation, BoxCox Transformation, abs(measurements - mean). However, for simplicity, all have been aprroximated as normal distribution. Further individually transforming the data columns can improve this analysis. 

* Interactive website is built on shiny & R, it requires a "server" to run. This can be my own computer, or an actual server (e.g., shinyapps.io). If it has to sent across as an markdown html file with run-time set to Shiny the recipient will be able to run the app as well *if* they have R, shiny, etc. installed. 

An alternate way to share a running shiny app that anyone can access is to host it using shinyapps.io for free. However, the free tier is not the fastest and not secure. Hence, the shiny version of the current assignment would be demonstrated during the onsite interview through personal laptop.

### Calculations
\ 

*  **Metric 1**: For any feature / specification, the **proportion of failure** across its column (dimensional feature) is an indication of its quality, which is given by:

  $$   \frac {\sum failures} {\sum failures + \sum pass}  $$
  

*  **Metric 2**: To investigate further on how badly the failed features/ parts stand out from its natural distribution, we do a weighted sum of its standard-score and fail_flag to develop a failure score. This should capture both, how often it failed and how badly it has failed. **Extend of Failure** is given by:
 
 $$ \frac {\sum (std\_scores * fail\_flag)}{\sum (std\_scores *fail\_flag) + \sum (std\_scores *pass\_flag) }  $$
 \ 
          Here fail_flag = 1  and pass_flag = 0
