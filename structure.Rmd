Tesla machines a part on two different machines – Machine 13 and Machine 15. For each machine there are 3 individual fixtures which hold the part in position while it is being machined.

Machine 13 has Fixtures D71, D72 & D73 

Machine 15 has Fixtures F11, F12 & F13

There are a number of critical dimensions which are measured on this part:

* DIA     – 	Diameter

* DIST    – 	Distance

* PERP    – 	Perpendicularity

* FLT     – 	Flatness

* CYL     – 	Cylindricity

* TP      – 	Position (Sum of squares of X and Z coordinate multiplied by 2)

* X       – 	Location in X Axis

* Z       – 	Location in Z Axis
